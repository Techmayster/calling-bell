        <h2 style="color:rgb(243, 244, 243); text-align: justify;">
        
          There are various entities related to the motor vehicles such as manufacturer, dealer,
          buyer, registration authority, insurance company. According to the norms, all the entities
          must collaborate for the successful registration of the vehicles. However, current system
          might get encountered with errors due to input of wrong or incomplete information and also
          some other consequences such as data manipulation which might be a threat to the system.
          The vehicle registration process is maintained by Regional Transport Office (RTO). RTO
          also maintains collection of road tax, license, emission certificate, no objection certificate.
          Maintaining process related to vehicles by the conventional method might obscure the path of
          making a system more reliable and complete. The current system face the problem of fraud
          detection i.e. if a fraud occurred, it is difficult to trace back as different entities such as
          manufacturer, dealer, RTO and insurance company works in their own terms. By bringing
          blockchain technology into the scenario helps us to get a more reliable solution as blockchain
          technology being a distributed ledger technology and also being more promising in data
          security and privacy helps for carving a more reliable and efficient system. By the means of
          the proposed project, it is an approach to solve problems underlying in the vehicle
          registration system and also bind all the different agencies related to vehicles under one portal
          and get them connected through blockchain technology. Binding them under one portal will
          make system more reliable as all of them would be in the chain and with blockchain every
          transaction log along with the timestamp would be available.
